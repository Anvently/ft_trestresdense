Failles possibles :
	- si on obtient un token valide pour un user "xyz", on supprime le compte, et quelqu'un recreait le compte "xyz", notre token est toujours valide.

TODO:

	Devops:
	- implement correct order for docker compose
		- add healthcheck for django app
		- filter healtcheck views in logs
	- dig into production server

	Pong:

BUGS:

- matchmaking: when refreshing page in tournament lobby (not initial),
	we can't reconnect to websocket because "a websocket connection is already opened"


Subject key point to check:

	-  Your website must be protected against SQL injections/XSS => Need to check
	-  Users can select a unique display name to play the tournaments => We don't care ?

	Other game module :
	- Create a matchmaking system to allow users to find opponents and participate
		in fair and balanced matches 
	- Optimize the performance and responsiveness of the new game to provide an
		enjoyable user experience. Regularly update and maintain the game to fix
		bugs, add new features, and enhance gameplay

	Support on all devices :
	- Ensure that users can easily navigate and interact with the website using
		different input methods, such as touchscreens, keyboards, and mice, depending
		on the device they are using
